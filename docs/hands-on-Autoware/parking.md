# Parking

## Overview

### How TO Use

1. Prepare a lanelet2 map and draw the `polygon` for the `parking_lot` area in the map. For reference on how to draw a lanelet2 map, see [lanelet2 map](../mapping/lanelet2-map.md).
2. When the vehicle is within the `parking_lot` area, the planner will switch to `Parking scenario`, and the `costmap_generator` and `freespace_planner` will start working.
3. The `costmap_generator` generates an `occupancy_grid` as the cost map for the `freespace_planner`.
4. The `freespace_planner` uses the cost map for path searching and planning.
5. The final `trajectory` is passed to the [trajectory following](./trajectory_following.md) module to generate control commands.

## Costmap Generator
As shown in the figure below, when the vehicle is within the `parking_lot` area (the light-yellow polygon inside the blue box), the `goal_pose`(the green box with the coordinate axis) is set, and there are `objects` (the red box).

After setting the target within the `parking_lot` area, the `occupancy_grip` cost map can be visualized. The drivable area has a lower cost, shown in gray, while the area occupied by obstacles has a higher cost, shown in black. It can be seen that the `lanelet` that overlaps with the `parking_lot` is also considered in the calculation of the `occupancy_grip`, as the vehicle may have to drive within the [lane_driving](./lane-driving.md) lane to reach the `parking_lot` while performing autonomous driving tasks. To avoid a gap in the map, the `lanelet` and `parking_lot` are connected by overlapping.

|minimum_lidar_height_thres|minimum height threshold for pointcloud data|-2.2(m)|
|expand_rectangle_size|expand object's rectangle with this value|1.0(m)|

## Freespace Planner
Given the vehicle's position `initial_pose` and `goal_pose`, the freespace_planner uses [A* Search](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/tree/main/planning/freespace_planning_algorithms) to plan a feasible trajectory for the vehicle to reach the `goal_pose`.

Because the `freespace planner` may generate overlapping trajectories that can not be handled by the [controller](./trajectory_following.md), so `freespace planner` split trajectory into serveral `partial trajectories` in order to make sure they can be used by `controller`.
