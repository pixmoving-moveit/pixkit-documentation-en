## 3 Product Overview

The main load-bearing structure of the PIXLOOP chassis is assembled with high-strength steel, and the surface cover is sprayed aluminum. The wheel suspension part is formed by professional stamping, and the design process uses finite element analysis to fully meet the various impacts and challenges brought about by vehicle motion control and different scene factors. Surface formed decking provides high mechanical strength combined with aesthetics. The chassis body adopts an intercommunicating box-type structure design, which provides relatively large space redundancy for chassis equipment installation and later expansion.

#### Headlight

The chassis headlights are controlled by the remote control toggle switch. Open the chassis, when the toggle switch is in the down position, the headlights are dimly lit in blue. When the toggle switch is in the upper position, the headlights are always on, and the light color is white. At the same time, the headlights provide a system development interface to meet the development of secondary headlight control strategies.

#### Turning light

The chassis turning lights are standard turning status lights, and the specifications of the front, rear, left, and right turn lights are the same. By default, the turning lights are automatically controlled, and a system development interface is provided at the same time. When the chassis triggers an emergency stop or loses contact, the four turning lights continue to "double flash".

#### Brake light(Stop light)

The chassis brake light is located at the rear of the body, also known as the tail light. When the system is turned on, the taillights will remain on continuously, and will be bright when braking. At the same time, the taillight provides a system development interface to meet the secondary taillight control strategy development.

### 3.3 Romote Control

The wireless remote control is the basic controller connected to the PIX chassis. All basic vehicle controls can be realized under the condition of the wireless remote control running. It is also the chassis control interface with the highest authority other than non-body control.

#### Tips for safe operation of the remote control

- When the remote control is turned on and off, it is necessary to ensure that each key is in the closed state, that is, parking, neutral, remote control takeover, and no throttle.

- After entering the remote control mode, do not push the accelerator to the maximum at one time to avoid danger, but slowly push the accelerator to control the direction to verify whether the buttons are working normally.

- The range of the remote control is guaranteed to be 50 meters in an open environment

- After parking, ensure that the vehicle is parked and in neutral, and avoid parking on ramps.

- For safety reasons, anyone should carefully read the relevant instructions of the remote control before using it, and do not hand over the remote control to people who are not familiar with the relevant operations to avoid danger;

- After the remote control signal is lost, the chassis triggers the safety protection mechanism, and the chassis stops in an emergency

- For your safety, before entering the automatic driving mode, please be sure to be familiar with the various operations of the remote control in advance, especially for the use of the emergency stop function, please confirm the remote control operation before entering the autonomous driving mode each time. For your safety, we have defined the absolute priority of the remote control at the industrial computer and the underlying protocol layer, that is, in any state of platform movement (please ensure that the remote control has sufficient power before each operation), as long as the remote control is powered on and in the remote control takeover state, the platform will enter the manual takeover mode to escort your safety test.
